Members of this family include: At5g60810 (RGF1), At1g13620 (RGF2), At2g04025 (RGF3), At3g30350 (RGF4), At5g51451 (RGF5), At4g16515 (RGF6), At3g02240 (RGF7), At2g03830 (RGF8) and At5g64770 (RGF9).",0.627427777,0.821665309,0.637332652,0.868301314,0.907668413,0.074554173,0.232762198,0.841785974,0.918063263,0.636367933
